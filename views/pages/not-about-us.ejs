        <h1>This is not about any one church or ministry. We are a collective of churches and prayer groups from all sorts of denominations and backgrounds!</h1>
        <p>We exist to Unite the Church to seek God's presence, transformation and awakening. We encourage Believers to come together to pray 24/7 for our communities to become better, for people who don't believe in God to learn about Him, and for our churches to grow stronger.</p>
